# ACC Self-Driving Car Student Competition

Welcome to the repository of the Mechatronic Engineering team of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) that participates in the American Control Conference (ACC) Self-Driving Car Student Competition.

# Project Overview
Our project aims to implement a machine learning model to provide a QCar with autonomous navigation capabilities. The model is based on image processing from the main camera, GPS positioning, and speed and steering control.

# Team
The team consists of fourth and fifth year undergraduate students in Mechatronics Engineering from PUCP, who are also members of the Intelligent Robotics Research Group from PUCP.
