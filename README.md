# ACC Self-Driving Car Competition

Welcome to the repository of the Mechatronic Engineering team of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) that participates in the American Control Conference (ACC) Self-Driving Car Student Competition.

# Project Overview
Our project aims to develop an autonomous driving system for a self-driving car that can navigate a cityscape model, following a predefined track and detecting traffic signs. We are using a combination of cameras and LIDAR sensors for perception and Python for the software architecture.
